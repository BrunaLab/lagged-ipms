## Introduction

<!-- AmNat Notes: communicate concise points, using either data or theory. Like Major Articles, they present insights of broad general significance and interest. Notes, on average, should be no more than 3000 words of text (not including the Literature Cited) and have no more than three figures and/or tables in print. -->

### Paragraph 1: MM and IPM broadly used, but technical challenges remain

1.  Two types of structured population models - matrix models [@leslie1945use; @caswell2001] and integral projection models [@ellnerIntegralProjectionModels2006] - are fundamental frameworks used to study demography and population dynamics.
2.  Their flexibility, in concert with a rapidly growing suite of software, data, and other resources [@ellnerDatadrivenModellingStructured2016; @levinIpmrFlexibleImplementation2021; @salguero-gomezCOMPADREPlantMatrix2015], have facilitated their use to study a wide range of topics in ecology, evolution, and conservation [@ellnerDatadrivenModellingStructured2016; @morrisQuantitativeConservationBiology2002; @croneHowPlantEcologists2011].
3.  While recent mathematical and statistical developments have expanded the scope of these applications [e.g., @brooksStatisticalModelingPatterns2019; @reesEvolvingIntegralProjection2016], a number of technical challenges remain.
4.  While many of these relate to general issues surrounding model development and validation [e.g., @williams2012avoiding], others stem from the fundamental challenge of using mathematical models - albeit highly advanced ones - to describe and analyze complex biological systems.

### Paragraph 2: Challenge of lagged effects

1.  Once such biological challenge is the implementation of alagged effects. It has long been recognized that there is the potential for lagged effects.
2.  Including lagged effects in models has been a major technical challenge, but there are now multiple approaches for doing so.
3.  The studies assessing the potential for lagged effects on vital rates find that they indeed appear to be prevalent [@eversLaggedDormantSeason2021; @scottDelayedEffectsClimate2022].

### Paragraph 3: Why does it matter when modeling?

1.  Lagged effects could be different in different habitat types.
2.  This could be a big reason for differences between habitats.
3.  Could also be important for stochastic vs. deterministic models.
4.  Here we...
5.  We conducted these analyses with both deterministic and stochastic IPMs.

<!-- TODO:

-->
```
In preliminary investigation we found that the survival and growth of plants was better explained by treating seedlings and mature plants separately.
Seedlings are physiologically different from small plants because they necessarily lack the underground reserves (of carbohydrates and meristems) that a small, mature plant may have.
Therefore, we used general IPMs to model population dynamics with seedlings treated as a separate discreet class not structured by size.
General IPMs allow for combinations of continuous and discrete states and transitions between them [@ellnerDatadrivenModellingStructured2016].

We built three classes of IPMs for comparison which each required different functional forms of their underlying vital rates models.
The simplest IPM was a general, density-independent, deterministic IPM with four sub-kernels: growth and survival ($P$, @eq-P), fecundity ($F$, i.e. production of new seedlings, @eq-F), probability of staying a seedling (always 0), and recruitment ($R$, i.e. seedling survival and establishment, @eq-R) ([@eq-mature; @eq-sdlg], @fig-lifecycle).
The probability of staying a seedling, was always equal to zero, since our definition of seedlings was first year plants only.

$$
n(z^{\prime},t+1) = R(z^\prime)n_s(t) + \int_L^U P(z^\prime,z) n(z,t)\;dz
$$ {#eq-mature}

$$
n_s(t+1) = \int_L^U F(z) n(z,t) \; dz
$$ {#eq-sdlg}

$$
R(z^\prime) = s_sG_s(z^\prime)
$$ {#eq-R}

$$
P(z^\prime, z) = s(z)G(z^\prime, z)
$$ {#eq-P}

$$
F(z) = p_f(z)f(z)g
$$ {#eq-F}

The number and size of mature plants in the next census is determined by seedlings entering the mature plant population (i.e. recruitment <!--# *Is* this recruitment? -->) and survival and growth (or regression) of mature plants ([@eq-mature]).
Seedlings survive ($s_s$) and grow into mature plants of a particular size ($G_s(z^\prime)$) ([@eq-R]).
Mature plants survive as a function of size ($s(z)$), and grow (or regress) to a new size as a function of their previous size ($G(z^\prime, z)$) ([@eq-P]).
Mature plants flower with a probability that is a function of size ($p_f(z)$) and produce a number of seeds as a function of size ($f(z)$), which germinate and establish as seedlings with probability $g$ ([@eq-F]).

Vital rate models for growth ($G_s(z^\prime)$ and $G(z^\prime, z)$) , survival ($s_s$ and $s(z)$), and flowering ($p_f(z)$) were fit using the long term demographic dataset.
For established plants, these three vital rates were modeled as a smooth function of size in the previous census using generalized additive models (GAMs) fit with the `mgcv` package[@mgcv] in `r version$version.string` [@rcoreteam2020] <!--# probably include a supplement with detail on things like basis, number of knots, etc. -->.
For consistency, seedling survival and growth were also modeled using GAMs, but without size in the previous census as a predictor (i.e. intercept only models).
For growth models ($G_s(z^\prime)$ and $G(z^\prime, z)$) a scaled t family distribution provided a better fit to the data than a gaussian fit as the residuals were leptokurtic with a simple gaussian model.

To estimate reproduction we drew on additional data sources to estimate the number of fruits per flowering plant as a function of plant size and the number of seeds per fruit (together $f(z)$).
Germination and establishment rates in continuous forest and forest fragments were estimated using data from ....
<!--# Emilio: add more info here -->

To build the general, density-independent, stochastic, kernel-resampled IPMs, we included environmental stochasticity in all vital rate models built using the long term demographic datset by adding a random effect of year (@fig-lifecycle).
The random effect of year was included using a factor--smooth interaction which allowed the relationship between plant size and vital rates to vary in functional form among transition years.
The kernel-resampling approach is to generate kernels corresponding to each transition year in the demographic dataset using the random smooths for year, and to iterate the IPM by drawing from these randomly.
This is equivalent to the matrix selection approach for matrix population models described by @caswell2001.

For the third method, we modeled the impacts of drought on vital rates explicitly and created general, density-independent, stochastic, parameter-resampled IPMs (*sensu* @metcalfStatisticalModellingAnnual2015).
We calculated the standardized precipitation evapotranspiraton index (SPEI) for our site using a published gridded dataset based on ground measurements [@xavierDailyGriddedMeteorological2016] as described in @scottDelayedEffectsClimate2022.
For all vital rate models fit using the long term demographic dataset, we modeled delayed effects of SPEI using distributed lag non-linear models with a maximum lag of 36 months [@scottDelayedEffectsClimate2022] (@fig-lifecycle).
To iterate these parameter-resampled IPMs, a random sequence of SPEI values was created by sampling years of the observed monthly SPEI data.
Then, 36 month lags are calculated for each year starting in February (the month of the demographic census).
These values are then used to predict fitted values from the vital rates models, generating different kernels at each iteration of the IPM.
With this method, the kernels of successive iterations are not entirely independent because the SPEI values used in calculating vital rates include values used in the previous two iterations, but they are ergodic.
<!--# ergodicity is somethign discussed in the Caswell book.  Basically, kernels eventually "forget" previous states.  I don't know if this last sentence really needs to be included, or if we are just inviting criticism from reviewers. -->

All IPMs were constructed and iterated <!--# optimized in notes/optimizing-meshpoints.Rmd which could be turned into supplemental -->using the `ipmr` package in R [@levinIpmrFlexibleImplementation2021].
The IPMs used 100 meshpoints and the midpoint rule for calculating kernels <!--# citation? -->.
For each type of IPM we iterated the model for 1000 time steps, discarding the first 100 time steps to omit transient effects.
Stochastic growth rates ($\lambda_s$) were calculated as the average $ln(\lambda)$ from each time step [@caswell2001] and back-transformed to be on the same scale as deterministic lambdas for comparison.
We used the distribution of established plant sizes and proportion of seedlings from the full dataset as a starting population vector.
While other starting population vectors were possible, the choice is of little importance as it will only impact transient dynamics, which we aren't interested in for this study.

To estimate uncertainty around the per-capita growth rates (lambdas), we created 500 bootstraps of the demographic dataset by sampling individual plants with replacement within each habitat.
For each bootstrap, we then re-fit vital rates models (all except germination and establishment rate, fruits per flowering plant, and seeds per fruit, which were estimated using different datasets), constructed IPMs, and calculated a value for lambda as described above.
We then used these bootstraped estimates of lambda to calculate bias corrected 95% confidence intervals [@ellnerDatadrivenModellingStructured2016].

This workflow was managed using the `targets` R package [@targets] which also allowed us to track computational time spent on each IPM for comparison.

### *Statistical analyses*

All about the stats.

## Results & Discussion

For all vital rates estimated using the long term demographic dataset, the DLNM model fit the best (dAIC = 0) followed by the model with a random effect of year, followed by the deterministic model (@tbl-aic).\
<!--# No longer true if random effect = different smooth for each year -->

Population growth rates were consistently higher in continuous forest compared to forest fragments across IPM types (@tbl-lambdas).

We found that the the choice of Integral Projection Model didn't change the relative ranking of lambda in Continous Forest and Fragments.

The time to iterate the DLNM models is much higher than than deterministic and kernel-resampled.

The greater use of computational resources is likely a result of `predict()` being much slower for GAMs with 2D smooths because the number of knots is much higher compared to the GAMs used for the vital rates models in the determinsitic and kernel-resampled IPMs.
<!--# also note that this can't really be paralellized because each iteration depends on the previous one.  There's *maybe* some potential speed gains in using multiple cores with predict.bam(), but unlikely to be substantial. -->

@fig-pop-states has some interesting things in it:

-   for the deterministic IPM (and the kernel-resampled IPM?) there are slightly more of the smallest plants and the largest plants in CF compared to FF (i.e. more medium sized plants in FF).

-   For the kernel-resampled IPM (random effect of year), the fluctuations are extremely similar between CF and FF

-   For the parameter-resampled IPM (DLNM) the size structure of the population is a LOT more variable in FF.
    This makes sense as we know lagged effects are more important in fragments.

-   Also, the fluctuations in size structure in CF do not match the fluctuations in FF as well (can see this by the increased spread of points in @fig-pop-states (B)

-   Also, in the parameter-resampled IPM (and only in this one), we see a shift toward smaller plants in FF compared to CF

These results are consistent with those of @kayeEffectStochasticTechnique2003, who found who found that the method effected stochastic lambda but relative ranking of populations was consistent.
