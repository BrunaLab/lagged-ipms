	abstract = {Reproduction by individuals is typically recorded as count data (e.g., number of fledglings from a nest or inflorescences on a plant) and commonly modeled using Poisson or negative binomial distributions, which assume that variance is greater than or equal to the mean. However, distributions of reproductive effort are often underdispersed (i.e., variance {\textless} mean). When used in hypothesis tests, models that ignore underdispersion will be overly conservative and may fail to detect significant patterns. Here we show that generalized Poisson (GP) and Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distributions are better choices for modeling reproductive effort because they can handle both overdispersion and underdispersion; we provide examples of how ecologists can use GP and CMP distributions in generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to quantify patterns in reproduction. Using a new R package, glmmTMB, we construct GLMMs to investigate how rainfall and population density influence the number of fledglings in the warbler Oreothlypis celata and how flowering rate of Heliconia acuminata differs between fragmented and continuous forest. We also demonstrate how to deal with zero-inflation, which occurs when there are more zeros than expected in the distribution, e.g., due to complete reproductive failure by some individuals.},

	abstract = {I present the results of a 2-year experiment comparing seed predation, seed germination, and seedling survivorship patterns of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata in forest fragments and continuous forest. These empirical results were compared with natural patterns of recruitment in permanent 5,000 m2 demographic plots adjacent to experimental areas. The number of naturally occurring seedlings established in demographic plots was 1.5–6 times greater in continuous forest than it was in 1-ha or 10-ha fragments. This result mirrors the pattern of seedling establishment in experimental transects, in which seeds in fragments were 3–7 times less likely to become established than those in continuous forest. Predation of experimentally sown seeds was extremely low at all sites, and is therefore not responsible for the observed pattern. Instead, reductions in seedling abundance in forest fragments are probably due to lower levels of seed germination. Forest fragments have higher air and soil temperatures, lower relative humidity, and increased leaf-litter accumulation, all of which can alter the cues used to initiate germination. While the growth of seedlings was similar in forest fragments and continuous forest, seedling survivorship in fragments was highly variable. These results suggest that altered environmental conditions may exacerbate reductions in plant recruitment resulting from modified plant-animal interactions. Strategies aimed at reducing the intensity of abiotic edge effects should therefore be incorporated into plant conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the demographic consequences of fragmentation for plant populations. By assessing the population structure of a common herb ( Heliconia acuminata) in an experimentally fragmented landscape in the central Amazon, we tested the predictions that fragmentation could reduce population density, alter population structure, and reduce reproductive effort. Population density in continuous forest varied six-fold, some areas having high density and others low density. Population density in small fragments and on the edges of large fragments was often low, but it was within the range of densities found in continuous forest, and the difference between locations was not significant. Heliconia populations in forest fragments were skewed toward smaller demographic size classes, however. Because reproduction in H. acuminata is positively correlated with plant size, these shifts were predicted to result in fewer flowering plants in forest fragments. The proportion of the population flowering in forest fragments and continuous forest was not significantly different, although there was a trend toward proportionately greater flowering in continuous forest. For plants that did flower, per-individual reproductive success (measured as developing fruit set) was the same in forest fragments and continuous forests. Our results suggest that per-individual and population-level reproduction by understory herbs in tropical forest fragments may be resistant to the detrimental consequences of fragment isolation. Our study also highlights the need to consider how fragmentation influences aspects of population structure and demography beyond abundance and fruit production, because these alternative measures of population structure can be modified in forest fragments in subtle, unexpected ways.},

However, plant ecologists also cautioned against literal interpretation of model predictions. Although academic studies have emphasized testing quantitative model predictions, such forecasts are not the way in which plant ecologists find matrix models to be most useful. Improving forecasting ability would necessitate increased model complexity and longer studies. Therefore, in addition to longer term studies with better links to environmental drivers, priorities for research include critically evaluating relative/comparative uses of matrix models and asking how we can use many short-term studies to understand long-term population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Matrix projection models occupy a central role in population and conservation biology. Matrix models divide a population into discrete classes, even if the structuring trait exhibits continuous variation ( e. g., body size). The integral projection model ( IPM) avoids discrete classes and potential artifacts from arbitrary class divisions, facilitates parsimonious modeling based on smooth relationships between individual state and demographic performance, and can be implemented with standard matrix software. Here, we extend the IPM to species with complex demographic attributes, including dormant and active life stages, cross- classification by several attributes ( e. g., size, age, and condition), and changes between discrete and continuous structure over the life cycle. We present a general model encompassing these cases, numerical methods, and theoretical results, including stable population growth and sensitivity/ elasticity analysis for density- independent models, local stability analysis in density- dependent models, and optimal/ evolutionarily stable strategy life- history analysis. Our presentation centers on an IPM for the thistle Onopordum illyricum based on a 6- year field study. Flowering and death probabilities are size and age dependent, and individuals also vary in a latent attribute affecting survival, but a predictively accurate IPM is completely parameterized by fitting a few regression equations.

Short-and mid-term climate projections indicate that strong changes in annual precipitation may strike more often in northern Patagonia. Data for recruitment, growth, and survival of Nothofagus dombeyi tree individuals were collected at several sites across the Nahuel Huapi National Park in Argentina. We combined mathematically all these different demographic stages into an Integral Projection Model to simulate 100-yr projections of simulated stand structure under different frequencies of extreme drought episodes. We projected total basal area and the number of individuals for three different initial stand types (i.e., young, medium, and old) and for varying drought frequencies (i.e., from 1 to 5 drought events every 100 years). Recruitment into the dbh {\textgreater}= 10 cm size class under normal conditions (i.e., without drought) was higher than under episodic drought conditions. In addition, survival under normal conditions was higher than under drought conditions, especially for small trees. Differences in growth were also important, with trees growing more vigorously under normal than under drought conditions. Our simulations predicted that N. dombeyi populations would experience a reduction in tree density in the mid-term if, as predicted by the IPCC projections, the frequency of future drought events increased. The simulations also showed that in those cases, young stands should suffer the most. Drought-mediated changes may induce a decline in the development of N. dombeyi forests in the mid-and long term by a drastic reduction in tree density.},

For continuously structured populations, where some continuous measure of individual state influences growth, survival or reproduction, integral projection models (IPMs) are commonly used. We provide a detailed description of the steps involved in constructing an IPM, explaining how to: (i) translate your study system into an IPM; (ii) implement your IPM; and (iii) diagnose potential problems with your IPM. We emphasize how the study organism's life cycle, and the timing of censuses, together determine the structure of the IPM kernel and important aspects of the statistical analysis used to parameterize an IPM using data on marked individuals. An IPM based on population studies of Soay sheep is used to illustrate the complete process of constructing, implementing and evaluating an IPM fitted to sample data. We then look at very general approaches to parameterizing an IPM, using a wide range of statistical techniques (e.g. maximum likelihood methods, generalized additive models, nonparametric kernel density estimators). Methods for selecting models for parameterizing IPMs are briefly discussed. We conclude with key recommendations and a brief overview of applications that extend the basic model.

	volume = {79},
	doi = {10.1890/08-1474.1},
	abstract = {Most plant and animal populations have substantial interannual variability in survival, growth rate, and fecundity. They also exhibit substantial variability among individuals in traits such as size, age, condition, and disease status that have large impacts on individual fates and consequently on the future of the population. We present here methods for constructing and analyzing a stochastic integral projection model (IPM) incorporating both of these forms of variability, illustrated through a case study of the monocarpic thistle Carlina vulgaris. We show how model construction can exploit the close correspondence between stochastic IPMs and statistical analysis of trait-fate relationships in a "mixed" or "hierarchical" models framework. This correspondence means that IPMs can be parameterized straightforwardly from data using established statistical techniques and software (vs. the largely ad hoc methods for stochastic matrix models), properly accounting for sampling error and between-year sample size variation and with vastly fewer parameters than a conventional stochastic matrix model. We show that the many tools available for analyzing stochastic matrix models (such as stochastic growth rate, lambda(S), small variance approximations, elasticity/sensitivity analysis, and life table response experiment [LTRE] analysis) can be used for IPMs, and we give computational formulas for elasticity/sensitivity analyses. We develop evolutionary analyses based on the connection between growth rate sensitivity and selection gradients and present a new method using techniques from functional data analysis to study the evolution of function-valued traits such as size-dependent flowering probability. For Carlina we found consistent selection against variability in both state-specific transition rates and the fitted functions describing state dependence in demographic rates. For most of the regression parameters de. ning the IPM there was also selection against temporal variance; however, in some cases the effects of nonlinear averaging were big enough to favor increased temporal variation. The LTRE analysis identified year-to-year variation in survival as the dominant factor in population growth variability. Evolutionary analysis of flowering strategy showed that the entire functional relationship between plant size and flowering probability is at or near an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) shaped by the size-specific trade-off between the benefit (fecundity) and cost (mortality) of flowering in a temporally varying environment.},

	abstract = {Patterns of survival and reproduction determine fitness, and there is a rich body of theory linking demography with evolution. For example, selection analysis can be used to predict changes in trait values, and by approximating selection, equations describing trait dynamics derived and evolutionary endpoints predicted. Here, we provide an overview of how these methods can be used to understand evolutionary dynamics and selection in a structured population modelled by an integral projection model (IPM). General expressions for selection are given, and we show how these can be approximated using eigenvalue sensitivities. Approximations for the dynamics of both the trait mean and variance are presented and compared to simulation results (IPMs and individual-based models) for monocarpic perennials. We describe how selection can be decomposed into components related to survival and reproduction and into components resulting from changes in demography versus changes in population structure. We show that, in an empirically based IPM, effects of changes in population structure can be a major component of the overall selection pressure. Most studies of selection in natural populations have focused entirely on selection due to changes in demography, so our results may help explain why directional selection is often predicted but no evolutionary response is observed. The endpoints of evolution, what we expect to see in nature, are explored using ideas from adaptive dynamics theory. The key methods are based on evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) and convergence stability. Efficient methods for finding an ESS are described. We then extend these ideas to function-valued traits, where it is assumed that an entire function can evolve, rather than a few parameters defining it. By combining theory for IPMs with ideas from several different fields, we show how the dynamics of ecologically complex, evolving systems can be understood.},

	abstract = {Temperature and precipitation determine the conditions where plant species can occur. Despite their significance, to date, surprisingly few demographic field studies have considered the effects of abiotic drivers. This is problematic because anticipating the effect of global climate change on plant population viability requires understanding how weather variables affect population dynamics. One possible reason for omitting the effect of weather variables in demographic studies is the difficulty in detecting tight associations between vital rates and environmental drivers. In this paper, we applied Functional Linear Models (FLMs) to long-term demographic data of the perennial wildflower, Astragalus scaphoides, and explored sensitivity of the results to reduced amounts of data. We compared models of the effect of average temperature, total precipitation, or an integrated measure of drought intensity (standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, SPEI), on plant vital rates. We found that transitions to flowering and recruitment in year t were highest if winter/spring of year t was wet (positive effect of SPEI). Counterintuitively, if the preceding spring of year t - 1 was wet, flowering probabilities were decreased (negative effect of SPEI). Survival of vegetative plants from t - 1 to t was also negatively affected by wet weather in the spring of year t - 1 and, for large plants, even wet weather in the spring of t - 2 had a negative effect. We assessed the integrated effect of all vital rates on life history performance by fitting FLMs to the asymptotic growth rate, log(t). Log(t) was highest if dry conditions in year t - 1 were followed by wet conditions in the year t. Overall, the positive effects of wet years exceeded their negative effects, suggesting that increasing frequency of drought conditions would reduce population viability of A.scaphoides. The drought signal weakened when reducing the number of monitoring years. Substituting space for time did not recover the weather signal, probably because the weather variables varied little between sites. We detected the SPEI signal when the analysis included data from two sites monitored over 20yr (2x20 observations), but not when analyzing data from four sites monitored over 10yr (4x10 observations).},

	abstract = {Decreased recruitment is hypothesized to be a primary mechanism driving the local extinctions of plant species from fragmented landscapes. A critical but untested assumption of this claim is that reductions in fecundity by individual plants actually result in demographic vulnerability at the population level. I tested this ‘‘recruitment limitation hypothesis’’ using three years of census data from 13 populations of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata, which I integrated with empirical estimates of seedling establishment into matrix demographic models. I asked: (1) How much recruitment is necessary for ␭ Ͼ 1? (2) What are the projected values of ␭ for H. acuminata populations in fragments and continuous forest, given empirical estimates of seedling emergence? (3) What are the actual values of ␭ for populations in fragments and continuous forest, and why might projected and estimated values of ␭ differ? (4) What other demographic stages contribute to ␭, and how are these affected by fragmentation? Simulation models suggest that extreme reductions in recruitment are necessary for population declines, and empirical estimates of seedling establishment were frequently below these thresholds. As a result, Heliconia acuminata populations in fragments are projected to shrink at a rate of 1–1.5\% per year, while those in continuous forest are projected to grow 2.3–4\% per year. Annual censuses, however, indicated populations in both continuous forest and fragments grew at rates well in excess of those projected by matrix models. This discrepancy is due to higherthan-predicted seedling numbers. While elasticity analyses indicated transitions related to growth and survivorship actually made the greatest proportional contribution to ␭, these results suggest that dispersal into fragments is common and helping populations overcome the negative demographic consequences of reduced seedling establishment. Additional demographic studies of plant populations in fragmented areas are urgently needed to identify other potential mechanisms responsible for population declines. Particular attention should be paid to appraising the effect of fragmentation on plant growth and survivorship, as altering these life-history stages may have the most serious consequences for population growth rates.},

However, little is known regarding the demographic mechanisms underlying changes in abundance in fragmented landscapes. Using six years of demographic data collected from {\textgreater}6600 individuals of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata, we calculated population growth rate (λ) in experimentally isolated 10-ha forest fragments, 1-ha forest fragments, and continuous forest. We then used life-table response experiment analyses to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for observed differences in λ. On average, λ ≈ 1.05 in continuous forest, while λ ≈ 1 in both 1-ha and 10-ha fragments. However, while the differences in λ between 10-ha fragments and continuous forest were largely attributable to the negative contribution of stage-specific fertility rates, reduced λ in 1-ha fragments was due to both reductions in reproductive rates and changes in the rate of plant growth. Our results show that similar reductions in λ in fragments of different sizes can be driven by distinct demographic mechanisms. Without comprehensive demographic data, attempts to mitigate the decline of populations in fragmented landscapes could be unsuccessful because they might be focusing on inappropriate demographic targets.},

The leaf area of plants in fragments also increased at half the rate it did in continuous forest sites. 3 It appears that the normal dry season stresses to which forest understorey plants are exposed are greatly exacerbated in fragments, causing plants to shed shoots and leaves. 4 The observed shifts in size could help explain why populations in fragments are more skewed towards smaller demographic stage classes than those in continuous forest. These shifts in size structure could also result in reduced abundances of flowering plants, as reproduction in H. acuminata is positively correlated with shoot number. 5 Fragmentation-related changes in growth rates resulting from abiotic stress may have significant demographic consequences.},

Our analysis demonstrates that (i) projection matrix dimension has significant effects on inferred demographic parameters, (ii) there are better‐performing methods than previously suggested for standardizing matrix dimension, and (iii) herbaceous perennial projection matrices are particularly sensitive to changes in matrix dimensionality. For comparative demographic studies, we recommend normalizing matrices to a common dimension by collapsing higher classes and leaving the first few classes unaltered.},

Models suggest that intergenerational effects have important implications for both population dynamical patterns and the evolution of life‐history traits. However, these will depend on the nature and duration of intergenerational effects. Here we show that manipulating parental food environments of soil mites produced intergenerational effects that were still detectable in the life histories of descendents three generations later. Intergenerational effects varied in different environments and from one generation to the next. In low‐food environments, variation in egg size altered a trade‐off between age and size at maturity and had little effect on the size of eggs produced in subsequent generations. Consequently, intergenerational effects decreased over time. In contrast, in high‐food environments, variation in egg size predominantly influenced a trade‐off between fecundity and adult survival and generated increasing variation in egg size. As a result, the persistence and significance of intergenerational effects varied between high‐ and low‐food environments. Context‐dependent intergenerational effects can therefore have complex but important effects on population dynamics.},

A relatively small amount of stochasticity can substantially impact the dynamics of a population whose growth is a function of deterministic and stochastic processes. Analyses of natural populations frequently neglect the latter. Even in a population that ﬂuctuates substantially with time, the results of a deterministic perturbation analysis correlated strongly with results of a perturbation analysis of the long-run stochastic growth rate. Population growth was, however, not uniformly sensitive to demographic rates across different environmental conditions. The overall correlation between deterministic and stochastic perturbation analysis may be high, but environmental variability can dramatically alter the contributions of demographic rates in different environmental conditions. This potentially informative detail is neglected by deterministic analysis, yet it highlights one difﬁculty when extrapolating results from long-term analysis to shorter-term environmental change.},

	doi = {10.1890/14-0481.1},
	abstract = {Mutualisms play a central role in the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Because many mutualisms have strong demographic effects, interspecific variation in partner quality could have important consequences for population dynamics. Nevertheless, few studies have quantified how a mutualist partner influences population growth rates, and still fewer have compared the demographic impacts of multiple partner species. We used integral projection models parameterized with three years of census data to compare the demographic effects of two ant species, Crematogaster laevis and Pheidole minutula, on populations of the Amazonian ant plant Maieta guianensis. Estimated population growth rates were positive (i.e., lambda {\textgreater} 1) for all ant-plant combinations. However, populations with only Pheidole minutula had the highest asymptotic growth rate (lambda = 1.23), followed by those colonized by Crematogaster laevis (lambda = 1.16), and in which the partner ant alternated between C. laevis and P. minutula at least once during our study (lambda = 1.15). Our results indicate that the short-term superiority of a mutualist partner (in this system, P. minutula is a better defender of plants against herbivores than C. laevis) can have long-term demographic consequences. Furthermore, the demographic effects of switching among alternative partners appear to be context dependent, with no benefits to plants hosting C. laevis but a major cost of switching to plants hosting P. minutula. Our results underscore the importance of expanding the study of mutualisms beyond the study of pair-wise interactions to consider the demographic costs and benefits of interacting with different, and multiple, potential partners.},

	abstract = {Changing environments result in alterations at all levels of biological organization, from genetics to physiology to demography. The increasing frequency of droughts worldwide is associated with higher temperatures and reduced precipitation that can impact population persistence via effects on individual immune function and survival. We examined the effects of annual climate variation on immunity in two sympatric species of garter snakes from four populations in California over a seven-year period that included the record-breaking drought. We examined three indices of innate immunity: bactericidal competence (BC), natural antibodies (NABs), and complement-mediated lysis (CL). Precipitation was the only climatic variable explaining variation in immune function: spring precipitation of the current year was positively correlated to Thamnophis sirtalis BC and NABs, whereas spring precipitation of the previous year was positively correlated to T. elegans BC and NABs. This suggests that T. elegans experiences a physiological time-lag in response to reduced precipitation, which may reflect lack of capital for investment in immunity in the year following a dry year. In general, our findings demonstrate compelling evidence that climate can influence wild populations through effects on physiological processes, suggesting that physiological indices such as these may offer valuable opportunities for monitoring the effects of climate.},

Physiology and its environmental forcing functions are assumed to affect both the total time available for activity and foraging and the resource budgets by affecting resource acquisition, costs, and handling. We extend the earlier model of Dunham and others (1989) and translate it into a computational algorithm. To satisfy conservation needs for accuracy, wide applicability, and rapid deployment, the model is relatively simple, uses as much data on the focal organism as possible, is mechanistically driven, and can be adapted to new organisms by using data for the new species, or the best available approximations to those data. We present 2 applications of the modeling approach. First, we consider a system with substantial information available, canyon lizards (Sceloporus merriami) studied by Dunham and colleagues in west Texas. In this case the focus is on integration of numerous inputs and the ability of the model to produce predictions that approximate counterintuitive empirical patterns. By using the wealth of specific data available, the model outperforms previous attempts at explanation of those patterns. Next, we consider a system with much less available information (forest-dwelling semi-fossorial frogs). The question here is how hydric conditions can become limiting. A model of evaporation from frogs buried in leaf litter was incorporated and it demonstrates how rainfall patterns can both supply water and put the frogs at risk of critical dehydration.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The timing of leaf unfolding in temperate woody species is predominantly controlled by the seasonal course of temperature in late winter and early spring. However, quantifying lagged temperature effects on spring phenology is still challenging. Here, we aimed at investigating lagged and potentially non-linear effects of daily maximum temperatures on the probability of leaf unfolding in temperate woody species growing across large elevational gradients. We analyzed 5280 observations of leaf-out time of four tree species (European beech, horse chestnut, European larch, Norway spruce) and one shrub species (common hazel) that were recorded by volunteers over 40 years at 42 locations in Switzerland. We used a case-crossover sampling design to match leaf-out dates with control dates (i.e., dates before or after leaf-out), and analyzed these data with conditional logistic regression accounting for lagged temperature effects over 60 days. Multivariate meta-analyses were used to synthesize lagged temperature and elevational effects on leaf unfolding across multiple phenological stations. Temperature effects on the probability of leaf unfolding were largest at relatively short lags (i.e., within ca. 10 days) and decreased with increasing lags. Short- to mid-term effects (i.e., within ca. 10 to 20 days) were larger for late-leafing species known to be photoperiod-sensitive (beech, Norway spruce). Temperature effects increased for the broadleaved species (horse chestnut, hazel, beech) with decreasing elevation, particularly within ca. 10 to 40 days, i.e., leaf unfolding occurs more rapidly at low elevations for a given daily maximum temperature. Our novel findings provide evidence of cumulative and long-term temperature effects on leaf unfolding, whereby the efficiency of relatively high temperatures to trigger leaf-out becomes higher shortly before bud burst. These lagged associations between temperature and leaf unfolding improve our understanding of phenological responses across temperate woody species with differing ecological requirements that occur along elevational gradients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Ecosystems across the United States are changing in complex ways that are difficult to predict. Coordinated long-term research and analysis are required to assess how these changes will affect a diverse array of ecosystem services. This paper is part of a series that is a product of a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Foundation’s Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) network. This effort revealed that each LTER site had at least one compelling scientific case study about “what their site would look like” in 50 or 100 yr. As the site results were prepared, themes emerged, and the case studies were grouped into separate papers along five themes: state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects and compiled into this special issue. This paper addresses the time lags theme with five examples from diverse biomes including tundra (Arctic), coastal upwelling (California Current Ecosystem), montane forests (Coweeta), and Everglades freshwater and coastal wetlands (Florida Coastal Everglades) LTER sites. Its objective is to demonstrate the importance of different types of time lags, in different kinds of ecosystems, as drivers of ecosystem structure and function and how these can effectively be addressed with long-term studies. The concept that slow, interactive, compounded changes can have dramatic effects on ecosystem structure, function, services, and future scenarios is apparent in many systems, but they are difficult to quantify and predict. The case studies presented here illustrate the expanding scope of thinking about time lags within the LTER network and beyond. Specifically, they examine what variables are best indicators of lagged changes in arctic tundra, how progressive ocean warming can have profound effects on zooplankton and phytoplankton in waters off the California coast, how a series of species changes over many decades can affect Eastern deciduous forests, and how infrequent, extreme cold spells and storms can have enduring effects on fish populations and wetland vegetation along the Southeast coast and the Gulf of Mexico. The case studies highlight the need for a diverse set of LTER (and other research networks) sites to sort out the multiple components of time lag effects in ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Rainfall is a key determinant of production and composition in arid and semi-arid systems. Long-term studies relating composition and water availability primarily focus on current-year precipitation patterns, though mounting evidence highlights the importance of previous-year rainfall particularly in grasslands dominated by perennial species. The extent to which lagged precipitation effects occur in annual grasslands, however, remains largely unexplored. We pair a long-term study with two manipulative experiments to identify patterns and mechanisms of lagged precipitation effects in annual grasslands. The long-term study captured variation in functional group (exotic annual forbs and grasses) abundance and precipitation across 8 years at three northern California grassland sites. We then tested whether lagged rainfall effects were created through seed production and litter (residual dry matter, RDM) by manipulating rainfall and litter, respectively. Rainfall from the previous-year growing season (both seasonal and total rainfall) shifted functional group abundance. High lagged rainfall was associated with increased grass and decreased forb abundance the following year. Current-year seasonal rainfall also influenced species composition, with winter rain increasing forb and decreasing grass abundance. Lagged precipitation effects were generally stronger for forbs than for grasses. Our experimental studies provided evidence for two mechanisms that contributed to lagged effects in annual grasslands. Higher rainfall increased seed production for grasses, which translated to more germinable seed the following year. Higher rainfall also increased biomass production and RDM, which benefited grasses and reduced forb abundance. Synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of previous-year precipitation in structuring annual community composition and suggest two important biotic pathways, seed rain and RDM, that regulate lagged community responses to rainfall. Incorporating lagged effects into models of grassland diversity and productivity could improve predictions of climate change impacts in annual grasslands.},

	abstract = {The seasonal match between folivore and leaf phenology affects the annual success of arboreal folivore populations because many folivores exploit developing leaves, which are an ephemeral resource. One strategy for folivores to exploit early-season leaves is to anticipate their emergence. The consequence of this behavior for trees is that individuals that set leaves earlier may experience greater rates of folivore damage, with potential negative fitness consequences. To test this hypothesis, we surveyed the early-season phenology, insect folivore damage, and acorn crop of a population of valley oaks (Quercus lobata) over a 3-year period. We found that trees that set leaves earlier experienced greater rates of folivore damage than trees that set leaves later in the season. In addition, we observed a lagged effect of folivore damage on acorn production, whereby trees with greater leaf damage produced fewer acorns in the subsequent year. These results indicate potential negative fitness consequences of earlier leaf phenology. Our study suggests that folivore pressure may be one factor that affects the optimal timing of leaf set in oaks.},

	abstract = {As ecosystems transform under climate change and expanding human activities, multidisciplinary integration of empirical research, conceptual frameworks and modelling methods is required to predict, monitor and manage the cascading effects on wildlife populations. For example, exposure to anthropogenic noise can lead to changes in the behaviour and physiology of individual marine mammals, but management is complicated by uncertainties on the long-term effects at a population level. We build on a decade of diverse efforts to demonstrate the strengths of integrating research on multiple stressors for assessing population-level effects. Using the case study of blue whales exposed to military sonar in the eastern north Pacific, we model how behavioural responses and environmental effects induced by climate change affect female survival and reproductive success. Environmental changes were predicted to severely affect vital rates, while the current regime of sonar activities was not. Simulated disturbance had a stronger effect on reproductive success than adult survival, as predicted by life-history theory. We show that information on prey resources is critical for robust predictions, as are data on baseline behavioural patterns, energy budgets, body condition and contextual responses to noise. These results will support effective management of the interactions between sonar operations and blue whales in the study area, while providing pragmatic guidance for future data collection to reduce key uncertainties. Our study provides important lessons for the successful integration of multidisciplinary research to inform the assessment of the effects of noise and other anthropogenic stressors on marine predator populations in the context of a changing environment.},

	doi = {10.5091/plecevo.2015.1110},
	abstract = {Background and aims – Large variation in annual berry production occurs in Vaccinium myrtillus L., and the variation has been associated with population cycling of many herbivores. Because of its ecological significance, variation in berry production has frequently been related to climatic variables. Methods – In an attempt to elucidate the possible causality of such relations, we have examined the seasonal and climatic control of growth rhythm and flowering performance of V. myrtillus in the field and in a controlled environment. We then reanalysed two long-running time series of berry production, with selected climatic factors as explanatory variables. Key results – Variables retained in the regression models were maximum temperature in June and mean temperature in August–September the year before fruiting, and maximum snow depth in April, minimum temperature in May, and hydrothermal ratio in June–July the current year. These factors could all be directly linked to critical plant processes and events such as timing of floral initiation, winter hardening, avoidance of frost injury during bloom, and drought avoidance in summer. Demonstration of superficial winter dormancy explained the vulnerability of V. myrtillus to winter frost injury and the need for stable snow cover. A highly significant lunisolar index corresponds to oscillations in ionizing cosmic radiation that by some unknown mechanism(s) may affect plant growth and development. Conclusions – We conclude that the explanatory variables obtained in the regression models for annual berry production are causally related to specific physiological mechanisms controlling crucial events in the annual life cycle of V. myrtillus. © 2015 Botanic Garden Meise and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Recent declines in numbers and juvenile recruitment in many elk (Cervus elaphus) herds in the western U.S. has sparked interest in factors that may cause these declines. Inadequate nutrition or delayed parturition, the latter of which may be caused by inadequate numbers of mature bulls (i.e., highly skewed sex ratios), may have separate or synergistic effects on population dynamics and productivity. We evaluated the implications of late parturition and summer-autumn nutrition on reproduction and survival of Rocky Mountain elk (C. e. nelsoni) using a captive herd of 57 cow elk. We induced early (Sep) and late breeding (Oct) and 3 levels of summer-autumn nutrition on the cows. Food was offered ad libitum at 3 levels of digestible energy (DE): high = 2.9-3.0 kcal of DE/g of diets, medium = 2.6-3.0 kcal/g, and low = 2.3-3.0 kcal/g. Within these ranges, DE content was gradually reduced from late June through early November to mimic seasonal changes in the wild. During summer and autumn, we measured calf growth; body mass, nutritional condition, and breeding dynamics of cows; and growth and pregnancy of yearlings. We also measured carry-over (i.e., time-lag) responses including over-winter calf and cow survival and parturition date and birth mass, as functions of previous summer-autumn nutrition and previous parturition date. Between autumn 1995 and spring 1998, we conducted 2 years of parturition-date, summer-autumn nutrition experiments, 2 winters of calf survival experiments, and 1 winter of cow survival experiments. Early birth provided calves with more time to grow before onset of winter. This “head-start” advantage was maintained through late autumn, but its magnitude was diluted in some instances due to faster growth of some late-born calves. Body mass, body fat, and timing and probability of conception by cows in autumn were little influenced by parturition date the previous spring. Summer-autumn nutrition significantly affected calves and their mothers. Growth of calves in the low and medium nutrition groups ceased by mid-September and late October. By December, calves in the high nutrition group were 40\% and 70\% heavier than calves in the medium and low groups, respectively. Cows in the high nutrition group accumulated about 75\% and 300\% more fat than cows in the medium and low groups by mid-October. Eighty percent of cows in the low nutrition group failed to conceive, and those in the medium group bred 10–14 days later than cows in the high group. Summer-autumn nutrition of calves influenced their probability of becoming pregnant as yearlings. Probability of pregnancy approached 100\% for those yearlings that had high summerautumn nutrition as calves and yearlings, despite near starvation their first winter of life. Winter survival of calves was related to their size at the onset of winter. Smaller calves lost more body mass daily than did large calves, and thus they survived fewer days through winter. Summer-autumn nutrition largely determined calf body size at the start of winter and, consequently, determined the proportion of winter survived. Survival of cows over winter was as related to body fat at the onset of winter as it was to nutrition during winter. Carry-over effects of summer-autumn nutrition and parturition date on birth characteristics the following spring were minor. We detected no significant carry-over effect of summer-autumn nutrition or autumn condition on birth mass, although reduced condition in autumn delayed subsequent parturition date. Extent of body fat depletion in cows during the winter-survival experiments in 1998 accounted for 45\% of the variation in parturition date. Ninety percent depletion delayed parturition an average of 34 days. Delayed parturition, of a magnitude expected due to highly skewed sex ratios (3 weeks under extreme conditions), probably has only a weak influence on vital rates of free-ranging elk. In contrast, fat accretion and probability of pregnancy of cows, and growth and overwinter survival of calves, were sensitive to small (10–20\%) differences in DE content of food. Digestible energy levels of our 2 lower nutrition levels reflect DE ranges reported for large ungulate herds during summer and autumn in western North America. Thus, our data suggest that limiting effects of summer-autumn nutrition on populations may be greater than often assumed, perhaps greater than those during winter in some ecosystems, and consequently indicate a need for greater understanding of nutrition's influence on population dynamics and how this influence varies across space and time. To enhance future research, we present animal- and vegetation-based guidelines for evaluating nutritional influences on elk populations.},

In addition to well-documented direct impacts of pesticides at the current stage or time, potential delayed “carryover” effects from past exposure at a different life stage may augment impacts on individuals and populations. We investigated the effects of current exposure and the carryover effects of past insecticide exposure on the individual vital rates and population growth of the solitary bee, Osmia lignaria. Bees in flight cages freely foraged on wildflowers, some treated with the common insecticide, imidacloprid, in a fully crossed design over 2 y, with insecticide exposure or no exposure in each year. Insecticide exposure directly to foraging adults and via carryover effects from past exposure reduced reproduction. Repeated exposure across 2 y additively impaired individual performance, leading to a nearly fourfold reduction in bee population growth. Exposure to even a single insecticide application can have persistent effects on vital rates and can reduce population growth for multiple generations. Carryover effects had profound implications for population persistence and must be considered in risk assessment, conservation, and management decisions for pollinators to mitigate the effects of insecticide exposure.},

	abstract = {The predictive adaptive response (PAR) hypothesis proposes that animals adjust their physiology and developmental trajectory during early life in anticipation of their future environments. Accordingly, when environmental conditions in early life match environmental conditions during adulthood, individual fitness should be greater. Here, we test this hypothesis in a long-lived mammal, the roe deer, using data from two contrasting populations, intensively monitored for more than 35 years. In the highly productive site, the fitness of female roe deer increased with the quality of environment during adulthood and, contrary to predictions of PAR, individuals born in good conditions always outperformed those born under poor conditions. In the resource-limited site, the fitness of female roe deer born in poor years was better than those born in good conditions in poor years when the animals were adult, but not in good years. Although consistent with predictions of PAR, we showed that this pattern is likely to be a consequence of increased viability selection during the juvenile stage for animals born in poor years. While PARs are often advanced in evolutionary medicine, our findings suggest that detailed biological processes should be investigated before drawing conclusions about the existence of this phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Drought, the most prominent threat to agricultural production worldwide, accelerates leaf senescence, leading to a decrease in canopy size, loss in photosynthesis and reduced yields. On the basis of the assumption that senescence is a type of cell death program that could be inappropriately activated during drought, we hypothesized that it may be possible to enhance drought tolerance by delaying drought-induced leaf senescence. We generated transgenic plants expressing an isopentenyltransferase gene driven by a stress- and maturation-induced promoter. Remarkably, the suppression of drought-induced leaf senescence resulted in outstanding drought tolerance as shown by, among other responses, vigorous growth after a long drought period that killed the control plants. The transgenic plants maintained high water contents and retained photosynthetic activity (albeit at a reduced level) during the drought. Moreover, the transgenic plants displayed minimal yield loss when watered with only 30\% of the amount of water used under control conditions. The production of drought-tolerant crops able to grow under restricted water regimes without diminution of yield would minimize drought-related losses and ensure food production in water-limited lands.},

Herein, we discuss the use of day length by animals at physiological and genetic levels, beginning with a comparative experimental study that shows the preeminent role of light in determining fitness in seasonal environments. Typically, at seasonally appropriate times, light initiates a cascade of physiological events mediating the input and interpretation of day length to the output of specific hormones that ultimately determine whether animals prepare to develop, reproduce, hibernate, enter dormancy, or migrate. The mechanisms that form the basis of seasonal time keeping and their adjustment during climate change are reviewed at the physiological and genetic levels. Future avenues for research are proposed that span basic questions from how animals transition from dependency on tropical cues to temperate cues during range expansions, to more applied questions of species survival and conservation biology during periods of climatic stress.},

	abstract = {The reproduction of many species is determined by seasonally-driven resource supply. But it is difficult to quantify whether the fecundity is sensitive to short- or long-term exposure to environmental conditions such as rainfall that drive resource supply. Using 25 years of data on individual fecundity of European female rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus, from semiarid Australia, we investigate the role of individual body condition, rainfall and temperature as drivers of seasonal and long-term and population-level changes in fecundity (breeding probability, ovulation rate, embryo survival). We built distributed lag models in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to account for both immediate and time-lagged effects of climate and other environmental drivers, and possible shifts in reproduction over consecutive seasons. We show that rainfall during summer, when rabbits typically breed only rarely, increased breeding probability immediately and with time lags of up to 10 weeks. However, an earlier onset of the yearly breeding period did not result in more overall reproductive output. Better body condition was associated with an earlier onset of breeding and higher embryo survival. Breeding probability in the main breeding season declined with increased breeding activity in the preceding season and only individuals in good body condition were able to breed late in the season. Higher temperatures reduce breeding success across seasons. We conclude that a better understanding of seasonal dynamics and plasticity (and their interplay) in reproduction will provide crucial insights into how lagomorphs are likely to respond and potentially adapt to the influence of future climate and other environmental change.},

	abstract = {1 The evolution of flowering strategies (when and at what size to flower) in monocarpic perennials is determined by balancing current reproduction with expected future reproduction, and these are largely determined by size-specific patterns of growth and survival. However, because of the difficulty in following long-lived individuals throughout their lives, this theory has largely been tested using short-lived species ({\textless} 5 years). 2 Here, we tested this theory using the long-lived monocarpic perennial Campanula thyrsoides which can live up to 16 years. We used a novel approach that combined permanent plot and herb chronology data from a 3-year field study to parameterize and validate integral projection models (IPMs). 3 Similar to other monocarpic species, the rosette leaves of C. thyrsoides wither over winter and so size cannot be measured in the year of flowering. We therefore extended the existing IPM framework to incorporate an additional time delay that arises because flowering demography must be predicted from rosette size in the year before flowering. 4 We found that all main demographic functions (growth, survival probability, flowering probability and fecundity) were strongly size-dependent and there was a pronounced threshold size of flowering. There was good agreement between the predicted distribution of flowering ages obtained from the IPMs and that estimated in the field. Mostly, there was good agreement between the IPM predictions and the direct quantitative field measurements regarding the demographic parameters λ, R0 and T. We therefore conclude that the model captures the main demographic features of the field populations. 5 Elasticity analysis indicated that changes in the survival and growth function had the largest effect (c. 80\%) on λ and this was considerably larger than in short-lived monocarps. We found only weak selection pressure operating on the observed flowering strategy which was close to the predicted evolutionary stable strategy. 6 Synthesis. The extended IPM accurately described the demography of a long-lived monocarpic perennial using data collected over a relatively short period. We could show that the evolution of flowering strategies in short- and long-lived monocarps seem to follow the same general rules but with a longevity-related emphasis on survival over fecundity.},

	abstract = {Hydrological alteration due to climate change events such as floods and drought is a significant threat to globally important wetlands, including floodplain wet grasslands. This research incorporated two field experiments with the aim to assess immediate and longer-term functional responses of floodplain plants to hydrological change. Plant introductions and transplants between a wetter riparian and a drier site in southern England were used to simulate hydrological change. Species showed immediate and differential responses to contrasting hydrologies. Rhinanthus minor, a hemi-parasitic annual species with ruderal traits, was lost from the riparian grassland within four weeks. The survival and production of a leguminous perennial, Lathyrus pratensis, in high groundwater levels soon decreased. However, the perennial Primula veris mostly functioned well in contrasting hydrological regimes, possibly because it can tolerate stress. The perennial wetland species Caltha palustris showed lag effects, over three years, when its hydrology was altered to a sub-optimal drier scenario by transplantation, with declining survival and a sustained reduction in leaf production and flowering. Disturbance caused by transplantation and weather conditions also affected its performance. Thus, this study shows that some functionally important floodplain species may succumb within weeks to a hydrological event facilitated by climate change, unless they are able to tolerate the challenging conditions, while the performance of other characteristic species could decline and continue to show constrained performance for years as a consequence of altered hydrology.},

	abstract = {Some grass species mount a defensive response to grazing by increasing their rate of uptake of silica from the soil and depositing it as abrasive granules in their leaves. Increased plant silica levels reduce food quality for herbivores that feed on these grasses. Here we provide empirical evidence that a principal food species of an herbivorous rodent exhibits a delayed defensive response to grazing by increasing silica concentrations, and present theoretical modelling that predicts that such a response alone could lead to the population cycles observed in some herbivore populations. Experiments performed under greenhouse conditions revealed that the rate of deposition of silica defences in the grass Deschampsia caespitosa is a time-lagged, nonlinear function of grazing intensity and that, upon cessation of grazing, these defences take around one year to decay to within 5 \% of control levels. Simple coupled grass–herbivore population models incorporating this functional response, and parameterised with empirical data, consistently predict population cycles for a wide range of realistic parameter values for a (Microtus) vole–grass system. Our results support the hypothesis that induced silica defences have the potential to strongly affect the population dynamics of their herbivores. Specifically, the feedback response we observed could be a driving mechanism behind the observed population cycles in graminivorous herbivores in cases where grazing levels in the field become sufficiently large and sustained to trigger an induced silica defence response.},

	abstract = {Habitat fragmentation remains a major focus of research by ecologists decades after being put forward as a threat to the integrity of ecosystems. While studies have documented myriad biotic changes in fragmented landscapes, including the local extinction of species from fragments, the demographic mechanisms underlying these extinctions are rarely known. However, many of them—especially in lowland tropical forests—are thought to be driven by one of two mechanisms: (1) reduced recruitment in fragments resulting from changes in the diversity or abundance of pollinators and seed dispersers or (2) increased rates of individual mortality in fragments due to dramatically altered abiotic conditions, especially near fragment edges. Unfortunately, there have been few tests of these potential mechanisms due to the paucity of long-term and comprehensive demographic data collected in both forest fragments and continuous forest sites. Here we report 11 years (1998–2009) of demographic data from populations of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata (LC Rich.) found at Brazil's Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP). The data set comprises {\textgreater}66,000 plant × year records of 8586 plants, including 3464 seedlings established after the first census. Seven populations were in experimentally isolated fragments (one in each of four 1-ha fragments and one in each of three 10-ha fragments), with the remaining six populations in continuous forest. Each population was in a 50 × 100 m permanent plot, with the distance between plots ranging from 500 m to 60 km. The plants in each plot were censused annually, at which time we recorded, identified, marked, and measured new seedlings, identified any previously marked plants that died, and recorded the size of surviving individuals. Each plot was also surveyed four to five times during the flowering season to identify reproductive plants and record the number of inflorescences each produced. These data have been used to investigate topics ranging from the way fragmentation-related reductions in germination influence population dynamics to statistical methods for analyzing reproductive rates. This breadth of prior use reflects the value of these data to future researchers. In addition to analyses of plant responses to habitat fragmentation, these data can be used to address fundamental questions in plant demography and the evolutionary ecology of tropical plants and to develop and test demographic models and tools. Though we welcome opportunities to collaborate with interested users, there are no restrictions on the use of this data set. However, we do request that those using the data for teaching or research purposes inform us of how they are doing so and cite this paper and the data archive when appropriate. Any publication using the data must also include a BDFFP Technical Series Number in the Acknowledgments. Authors can request this series number upon the acceptance of their article by contacting the BDFFP's Scientific Coordinator or E. M. Bruna.},
